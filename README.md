# Final-Project
BST 260 Final Project; Fall 2021


Welcome! This repository contains all our files for the final project assignment in BST 260. The Rmd files (and corresponding htmls) have been named in the order that they should be reviewed--from first to fourth. 

## About the Data

We obtained our starting dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney). The dataset contains information for movies found on the streaming platforms Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Prime Video. The movies in the dataset were scraped from these streaming services per United States availability, then cross-referenced with other countries to find how available they are on the streaming platforms internationally. The dataset contains information on ratings (IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes), movie release year, intended age group of audience, country availability, genres, languages, and more.
